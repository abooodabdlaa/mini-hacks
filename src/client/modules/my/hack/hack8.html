    Customer satisfaction is vital to the success of your company. If your
    customer is satisfied with your product, they will be happy and excited to
    share it with their friends and family. As a result, your company will have
    more users, who tend to be more loyal than the users you got through the
    marketing campaign.
    <br /><br />
    One way to improve customer satisfaction is through customer engagement. You
    want to continuously interact with your customers whenever the time is
    right, such as when they just sign up for a new account in your system or
    buy a new product. To do that, you need an application. However,
    implementing an application from scratch is time-consuming and costly
    because you need a software team. To implement the application for engaging
    with your customers quickly, you need artificial intelligence (AI) tool like
    Vonage AI Studio.
    <br /><br />
    With Vonage AI Studio, you can customize the flow for your customer journey
    to meet your exact use case just by clicking and dragging items. In this
    article, letâ€™s learn how to integrate Salesforce into Vonage AI Studio so
    that you can take advantage of the existing user data you already have in
    Salesforce to improve customer engagement.
