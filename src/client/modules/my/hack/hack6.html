    Acme Inc. is a multi-national conglomerate dealing with customers across the
    globe. Your Salesforce administrator has asked for a means to automatically
    convert the Annual Revenue for each account to any of the supplied
    currencies your organization recognizes (EUR, GBP, and JPY).
    <br /><br />
    As a developer for Acme Inc., you recognize that Salesforce already has the
    capacity for managing multiple currencies and you simply need to create an
    Apex class to perform those conversions. Your org is not configured for
    this, nor does it have any idea what the current conversion rates are.
    <br /><br />
    You realize that this task requires several tasks to be completed.
    <br /><br />
