    While having plants at home is lovely and helps fight climate change, taking
    care of plants can be sometimes hard. That‚Äôs why <a
        href="https://github.com/developerforce/tdx23-lwc-hack"
        target="_blank"
    >this repo</a> contains an app
    that allows users to keep track of their plants and the care that they need
    in Salesforce. Let‚Äôs become greener üåø!
    <br /><br />
    Here comes your challenge! The list of species in the system can be long,
    and the user experience team has suggested that you, our awesome developer,
    add an input that allows filtering them.
    <br /><br />

            To complete this mini hack, you can use any org of your choice.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the org that you chose or created, deploy the existing plant tracker app from <a
                href="https://github.com/developerforce/tdx23-lwc-hack"
                target="_blank"
            >this repo</a>, using Code Builder or VS Code.
            <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
                <li>
                    If you are planning to use Code Builder, 
                    <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
                        <li>Install Code Builder <a

                        <li>
                            Open Code Builder from App launcher. When you‚Äôre prompted to link a
                            repo, link <a
                                href="https://github.com/developerforce/tdx23-lwc-hack"
                                target="_blank"
                                >https://github.com/developerforce/tdx23-lwc-hack</a
                            >
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you are planning to use VS Code, 
                    <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
                        <li>Create a folder on the Desktop with your name.</li>
                        <li>Using Terminal, navigate or <code class="language-js">cd</code> into the folder you created.</li>
                        <li>Clone the repo using the following command
                            <pre class="language-js">git clone https://github.com/developerforce/tdx23-lwc-hack</pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>Open the cloned repo in VS Code.</li>
                        <li>Authorize an org of your choice using CLI commands or the command palette.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            In the terminal of VS Code or Code Builder, execute the following command. This will
            give you access to the app that you‚Äôll work with, load some sample
            data, and retrieve the metadata files you‚Äôll work
            with.
            <br />
            <pre class="language-shell">./setup.sh</pre>
            <p>
                Check everything is fine by opening the app called ‚ÄúMy Plants‚Äù,
                going to the ‚ÄúSpecies Explorer‚Äù tab, and verifying you see this:
            </p>

            <br />
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="dx-text-heading-5">Requirements</div>
    <div>
        The business requirement says ‚ÄúWhen a user types a value on a filter
        input, the <code class="language-shell">speciesList</code> component will show plants whose
        <code class="language-shell">Name</code> or <code class="language-shell">Description__c</code> contains the typed
        value‚Äù. There are two additional conditions:
        <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
            <li>
                The <code class="language-shell">speciesList</code> component should only change when
                the user has typed at least 3 characters.
            </li>
            <li>
                The returned species by filter value must be cached, to
                implement the page performance.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <p>This is how the page needs to look like, with the new filter input:</p>
    <img src="https://sf-mini-hacks.herokuapp.com/resources/lwc2.png" style="max-width:100%;"/>
    <br />
    <p>The rough steps to complete this challenge are:</p>
   
        
    <ul class="slds-list_dotted parent">
        <li>
            Create the filter using the <code class="language-shell">lightning-input</code> base
            component. <a
                href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/overview/components"
                target="_blank"
            >
                Here is a link </a
            > to the base component library.
        </li>
        <li>
            Import the existing Apex method <code class="language-shell">getFilteredSpecies</code> from the <code class="language-shell">SpeciesService</code> class into the
            <code class="language-shell">speciesList</code> component, instead of the one that's
            being used. Check out the <a
                href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.apex"
                target="_blank"
                >documentation
            </a> if you don‚Äôt know how to do it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Invoke <code class="language-shell">getFilteredSpecies</code> passing in the value that
            the user types on the <code class="language-shell">lightning-input</code> component.
            Remember this should only happen if the user wrote at least 3
            characters, and that filtered species must be cached.
        </li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Tip: If you don‚Äôt know how to deploy the code, try using <a
            href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_force_source.htm"
            target="_blank"
        >
            source commands
        </a> on the Code Builder terminal. Alternatively, you can also use VS Code Salesforce extension
        pack commands that show up on the command palette or when right clicking
        a file. 
        <br/>
        Remember in source tracked orgs (such as scratch orgs) you can
        use <code class="language-shell">push</code> and <code class="language-shell">pull</code>, while in non source tracked orgs (such as developer
        orgs) you‚Äôll have to use <code class="language-shell">deploy</code> and <code class="language-shell">retrieve</code>.
        <br /><br />
        Good luck with this green & sustainable challenge!

    Once a staffer verifies your hack, make sure you 
    <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
        <li>Log out of your org on the browser.</li>
        <li>Delete the folder/directory you created that contains the SFDX project.</li>
