    This is a basic overview of how to analyze data with Tableau. In this hack,
    participants will create a

        target="_blank"
        >&nbsp;datasource&nbsp;</a
    >
    from a data file (CSV) and then build a simple dashboard. The dashboard will
    consist of 4 charts (or Vizzes as we call them), and should more or less
    have the same structure. <br /><br />
    To do this, participants will login to our Tableau Server site and create a
    new workbook. They will upload the data files using Web Authoring, and
    create a dashboard that looks like this:

        class="slds-align_absolute-center slds-p-around_small"
    />
    The dataset consists of survey responses from airline passengers. Our goal
    is to get a better understanding of what factors lead to people having a
    high or low satisfaction rating, and what we can do to drive higher
    satisfaction among our passengers.

            Viz 1: What kind of passengers are not satisfied - The 1st question
            we want to answer is what kind of passengers are most likely to be
            not satisfied with their travel experience? Start by creating a new
            calculated field named [# Passengers], using the following formula:
            <code class="language-js"
                >COUNT([airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv]).</code
            >
            and drag it onto columns. Next, drag [Type of Travel] and
            [Satisfaction] to rows.
            <p>
                In order to add [Customer Type] as the color but keep the label
                at the end of each bar, there is a trick. Add [# Passengers] a
                second time to the Columns shelf (should be there twice). Click
                on one of the [# Passengers] fields in the Columns shelf and
                change it to a dual-axis chart. The chart will now have axis on
                both the top and bottom, so click on the top axis and make sure
                the Synchronize Axis option is checked, and then uncheck the
                Show Header option.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should now see 2 sections under the Marks shelf, so add
                [Customer Type] to the Color of the lower section. On the upper
                section, add [# Passengers] to the Label and then click on it to
                add a Quick Table Calculation for Percent of Total. Your chart
                should now look like the image below
            </p>
            <img
                src="https://sf-mini-hacks.herokuapp.com/resources/TabViz1.png"

            Viz 2: Explain Data - Based on the Viz we just finished, we can see
            that business travel is pretty split between satisfaction but
            personal travel has a much wider gap between satisfied and not
            satisfied passengers. In order to understand why this gap exists,
            let’s use Explain Data. Click on the bar for Personal + Not
            Satisfied and click on the Data Guide button. This will pop out the
            Data Guide panel, which has a section for Explanations related to
            the mark your selected. Click on the button labeled
            <code class="language-js">[High] # Passengers</code> to see possible
            explanations for why this value might be high. If you expand the
            section for In-flight Wifi Service, you should see a thumbnail of a
            new chart. Click the Open in Worksheet button to create this Viz
            automatically.
            <p>
                This Viz shows each combination of [Customer Type], [Type of
                Travel], & [Satisfaction], and the selected (blue) mark
                represents returning customers who are on personal travel and
                were not satisfied. Change the mark type from Circle to Shape
                and drag [Satisfaction] to shape. Now you can see why wifi
                service is such a significant indicator for poor satisfaction,
                as all the satisfied passengers had higher wifi service scores.
            </p>

            Viz 3: Wifi Scores vs Satisfaction - Now that we know how important
            wifi service is, where do we need to get to in order to convert not
            satisfied passengers to satisfied? Create a new sheet, and switch
            the mark type to Radial. The Level icon only accepts dimensions (not
            measures), so click on [In-flight Wifi Service] and click the
            Convert to Dimension button. Drag [In-flight Wifi Service] and
            [Satisfaction] to Level, and [# Passengers] to the Angle. This will
            create a radial chart with Wifi service scores on the inside, and
            what % of passengers are satisfied/not satisfied. There’s a tiny
            slice for scores of 0, but it’s so small that it can be distracting
            so filter that value out. This shows that when the scores are 4-5,
            the % of Satisfied passengers goes way up. Scores between 2-3,
            however, show ~75% of passengers are not satisfied.
            <img
                src="https://sf-mini-hacks.herokuapp.com/resources/TabViz3.png"
                class="slds-align_absolute-center slds-p-around_small"
            />
        </li>
        <li>
            Viz 4: Does age matter when comparing Wifi service and satisfaction?
            - The last question we should ask is does this realization (that low
            wifi scores correlates to low satisfaction), apply to everyone or
            just a specific demographic? We should check to see if this applies
            more to younger or older passengers. Create a new sheet and change
            the mark type to Sankey. Drag [Satisfaction] and [In-flight Wifi
            Service] to Levels, and [# Passengers] to Link. This shows a similar
            view to the Radial chart we created in the last step, but let’s add
            Age to the mix.
            <p>
                Since [Age] is the exact age of passengers, we should bin these
                values to make the analysis a bit easier to view. Click on the
                [Age] field and click Create → Bin. Tableau will suggest a bin
                size based on the range of values in that field, but let’s round
                up to an even number like 10. Now drag the new [Age (bin)] field
                to Level, and you should see a Viz like the image below. There
                were a few dimensions with a small # of passengers (Wifi Service
                = 0, Age (bin) = 0, 70, 80), so feel free to filter them out.
            </p>
            <img
                src="https://sf-mini-hacks.herokuapp.com/resources/TabViz4.png"
                class="slds-align_absolute-center slds-p-around_small"
            />
            <p>
                By looking at the links between Wifi Service scores of 2 & 3 for
                Not Satisfied passengers, the largest links are for 20-30 year
                olds and 30-40 year olds. This means we can focus on improving
                the wifi service score for this specific demographic, perhaps by
                looking at how they use wifi on flights and seeing what we can
                do.

            Dashboard: Passenger Satisfaction Analysis - The last step is to
            combine the Vizzes into a single interactive dashboard. Publish the
            dashboard to the [Minihacks] project, and you’re done!
