    You are assigned a task to create a workflow that automates the creation of
    incidents. Your workflow also connects to an external service (Zoom) in a
    no-code environment. Follow the instructions below to complete the hack.

                    Imagine there’s been a service outage at your company —
                    something is broken and needs to be fixed immediately. You
                    need to assemble your best people and resolve the emergency,
                    so your customers can return to their regular day-to-day
                    undisturbed. You will create a workflow within Slack that
                    automates this process for you and also keeps a record of
                    the incident so that you can use the information in a post
                    mortem process and prevent future incidents.

                <li>
                    In this hack, you’ll be using the new and improved Workflow
                    Builder, which is built right into Slack. Workflow Builder
                    offers a set of tools to help you automate routine tasks and
                    processes in Slack. Workflows can be as simple or as complex
                    as you’d like, and can even be connected to other apps and
                    tools you use to get work done. In this particular hack,
                    you’ll be adding steps within your workflow that connect to
                    third-party services like Zoom, an online video conference
                    service, but first let’s take a look at what a workflow in
                    Slack is.

                    >. Some examples of t hese steps are: creating a channel,
                    sending a message or even connecting with a third-party
                    service. Triggers are events that can be found in and
                    outside of Slack that start a workflow. An example of a
                    trigger is when an emoji reaction added to a message, a
                    person joins a channel or when a workflow link is pressed.
                    Workflow links are a special type of trigger that when
                    posted into Slack unfurls to reveal a start button. Pressing
                    the start button will start the associated workflow. These
                    links can be embedded into Canvas documents, added to a
                    channel bookmark or be tossed around as a message and is the
                    trigger that we’ll use in this particular hack.

                    Now that you have an idea of what workflows are, let’s
                    automate the process of creating incidents by using Workflow
                    Builder.

                    <li>
                        Invite the incident responder to the newly created

                    <li>
                        And finally, pin the message to channel so folks can
                        refer back to it.

                </ol>
            </ul>
            Seems like a lot of steps? Not to worry! Let’s take advantage of the
            templates that you have at your disposal built right into Workflow
            Builder. You’ll be making some modifications to customize it to your
            liking.

            Creating your very first workflow
            <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
                <li>
                    First, let’s locate how to get to the Workflow Builder tool.
                    Click on the workspace name in the top left corner and
                    scroll down to <i>Tools</i> and select
                    <i> Workflow Builder. </i> Once you do this, you should see
                    a new window pop up. From here, click
                    <i>Create Workflow</i> and then expand the templates sidebar
                    by clicking <i>See all templates.</i> Lastly, choose the
                    <i>Incident</i> Response template. With this, your
                    foundation has been built.

            Setting up your test environment
            <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
                <li>
                    Since you’ll be working on a workspace with other
                    colleagues, let’s take some steps to make sure you don’t
                    pollute any of your main work channels. Create a new channel
                    by clicking on the channels tab in the left sidebar. Name
                    your channel something like incident- + a possible incident
                    at your company + the date the incident occurred
                    <i> e.g. incident-broken-sidebar-091222.</i> You don’t need
                    to add anyone to this channel, as you’ll be using it just
                    for yourself.

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Customizing your workflow
            <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
                <li>
                    Now that you’ve created your template, take some time to
                    peruse the steps and understand what your workflow is
                    automating. If you like, you can even test out your workflow
                    now within your test channel by publishing it, posting the
                    workflow link and c licking the start button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let's add some of these customizations to make this workflow
                    your own. Workflow links can live within a channel and a
                    canvas, so it's nice to notify the user that the workflow
                    has been started with a visual cue. For this, let's add an
                    "only visible to you" message (aka an ephemeral message)
                    right after the form step. You'll need to hover your mouse
                    between the <i>Collect info in a form</i> and
                    <i>Create channel steps </i> until you see a plus sign.
                    Press the plus sign, choose <i>Messages</i>, and then Send
                    an <i>"only visible to you" message </i>from the right-hand
                    navigation. Here's where you can get creative and make the
                    message sense! As a point of reference, you'll want to add
                    details like the <i>Incident title</i> and
                    <i>Short description</i>, which you can do by pressing the
                    <i>Insert a variable </i>
                    button in the bottom right. Also, you can choose who and
                    where this message will be sent — choose what makes the most
                    sense to you in the context of an incident. Think about what
                    kind of information would be helpful to users kicking off
                    this workflow.

                <li>
                    One of Workflow Builder’s strongest points is its ability to
                    hook into other services — without the use of any code. In
                    this case, once an incident has occurred, you want to swarm
                    all in one place and discuss the best path for moving
                    forward. For this, you will create a Zoom conference room.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you already have a Zoom account, perfect! If not, you’ll
                    need to create one on the
                    <a href="https://zoom.us/signup#/signup" target="_blank"
                        >&nbsp;Zoom website</a
                    >. A free trial account will suffice. Once you have your
                    account ready, find the <i>Update the channel topic</i> step
                    and click the plus sign after it and choose <i>Zoom</i> >
                    <i>Create a meeting</i> from the right hand navigation.
                    You’re welcome to choose all the variables that make sense
                    to you — the answers from the form are a good place to
                    start!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, to make sure everyone knows which Zoom room discussion
                    is taking place, add the Zoom URL to the message that is
                    posted in channel. Head to the
                    <i>Send a message to Channel name</i> and find the pencil
                    icon in the top right corner. Within the message, let’s add
                    “Zoom Room:” and then insert a variable linking the Zoom
                    <i>Join URL</i>. And voila, you’re done!

                <li>
                    Before our workflow can be used in the wild, you’ll need to
                    publish it first. In the top right corner of the workflow
                    steps window, hit <i>Publish</i>. Remember to change the
                    name of the workflow to include your name or something to
                    make it unique!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, copy the workflow link by hitting the
                    <i>Copy Link</i> button and then choose one of the following
                    places to post it:
                    <ol class="slds-list_ordered">
                        <li>As a message within a channel.</li>

                        <li>Within a Canvas, as part of a document.</li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Once you’ve decided this, hit the

                    If you’re looking to add steps outside of the ones that you
                    see within Workflow Builder, you can do so by coding your
                    very own step! This section is a quick overview of how you
                    could do this for your app. You will be adding a step that

                    and peruse through the code to get an idea of what this
                    function does. Once you’re ready, follow the instructions
                    within the README to get your very own GitHub function
                    running. Note that once you get to the
                    <i>Create a Link Trigger</i> step, you can skip it and
                    immediately run the command <i>slack run</i>. Once you do
                    this, head back to your workflow that you created above and
                    add one final step by searching for the
                    <i>Create GitHub issue</i> step that will be available under
                    the name of the app that you created. After this has been
                    added, publish your workflow and check if GitHub issues are
                    created when your workflow runs! If so, you’ve successfully
                    created your very own step!
