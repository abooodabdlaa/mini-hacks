    Rainy Beach Gym wants to develop its own weight training app for their
    members to track their progress. No more notebooks and pencils! They want
    each athlete to be able to track which exercises they completed, how much
    weight they lifted, and how many times. This will allow athletes to see
    their own progression and even casually compete with each other. <br />
    Custom objects that will be installed in your org in next step:
    <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
        <li>Workout (PARENT)</li>
        <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
            <li>
                Fields:
                <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
                    <li>Average Weight (average of sets from last workout)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Set (CHILD) A set is group of reps (repetitions)</li>
        <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
            <li>
                Fields:
                <ul class="slds-list_dotted">
                    <li>Exercise picklist (deadlift, squat, bench press)</li>
                    <li>
                        Reps. One rep is a single time an athlete pics up a
                        weight.
                    </li>
                    <li>Weight</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    For example: the weightlifting coach tells the class to do 3 sets of bench
    press and 10 reps per set, for a total of 30 reps. Kyla will start her first
    set with 27 kilos, and lift it 10 times. For her second set, she adds more
    weight and is only able to lift it 8 times. She records 30 kilos and 8 reps.
    She reduces the weight to 28 for set three, and is able to do all 10 reps
    for the last three sets. Her goal was to complete 30 reps total, but she
    actually completed 28. No big deal.

        Run the Setup flow that you’ll find in the utility bar in the bottom
        left.
    </li>
    <li>Build your flow according to the requirements below.</li>
    <br />
    <div class="dx-text-heading-5">Requirements</div>
    Build a screen flow.
    <ul class="slds-list_dotted parent">
        <li>
            On the first screen, the athlete chooses one of three exercises,
            enters the number of sets and number of reps that she intends to do.
        </li>
        <li>
            The second screen needs to display text that says “Set 1” and the
            athlete will enter the weight and number of reps actually completed.
            Call this element “Set Screen".</li>
            <li>Where the athlete enters weight, use a default weight: 
            <ul class="slds-list_dotted parent">
                <li>
                    Display the average weight (a field on the Workout object)
                    of the last workout of this exercise. Hint: sort by the DATE
                    field not the Created Date Field. All your data will be
                    created today.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            When the athlete hits next, the text will display “Set 2” and the
            athlete will again enter the weight and number of reps actually
            completed.
        </li>
        <li>
            The athlete should see the Set screen for as many sets as she has.
        </li>
        <li>
            Behind the scenes this flow will create a workout record and the
            relevant number of set records.
        </li>
        <li>The default date for the sets and exercise is today’s date.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="dx-text-heading-5">Test your Flow</div>
    Enter the data for this scenario.
    <br />
    <p>
        For example: the weightlifting coach tells the class to do 3 sets of
        bench press and 10 reps per set, for a total of 30 reps. Kyla will start
        her first set with 27 kilos, and lift it 10 times. For her second set,
        she adds more weight and is only able to lift it 8 times. She records 30
        kilos and 8 reps. She reduces the weight to 28 for set three, and is
        able to do all 10 reps for the last three sets. Her goal was to complete
        30 reps total, but she actually completed 28. No big deal.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Screen 1: Bench Press, 3 sets, 10 reps per set.</p>
    <p>Set 1: Weight 27, reps 10.</p>
    <p>Set 2: Weight 30, reps 8.</p>
    <p>Set 3: Weight 28, reps 10.</p>
    <br />
    To successfully complete this challenge, you’ll have 1 new workout record
    created, with 3 set records attached to that workout with the data above.
